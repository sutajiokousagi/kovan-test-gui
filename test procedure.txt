Internal procedure:

0) Begin reading from acceleromter

1) Play a square wave, measure ADC0, ensure it's moving

2) Test servo controllers.  For each servo in 0 1, 2, 3:
2.1) Move servo X backwards, measure ADC12+X
2.2) Move servo X forwards, measure ADC12+X

3) Test serial ports:
3.1) Send data out onboard serial, read in external serial
3.2) Send data out external serial, read in onboard serial

4) Test digital IOs.  For x in 0, 1, 2, 3:
4.1) Pull pin x down, measure pin 7-x
4.2) Pull pin x up, measure pin 7-x
4.3) Pull pin 7-x down, measure pin x
4.4) Pull pin 7-x up, measure pin x

5) Check onboard micro USB using subtest module

6) Check if the accelerometer responds to I2C

7) Check WIFI and other USB port
7.1) Connect to a known access point
7.2) Download file onto the mounted USB drive
7.3) Check SHA256 sum to verify its correctness

8) Plug in 7.4V battery
8.1) Measure battery voltage
8.2) Unplug power supply
8.3) Measure battery voltage

9) Check motor drivers.  For each motor x:
9.1) Spin motor forwards
9.2) Spin motor backwards, and measure motor ADC

10) Unplug 7.4V battery

11) Test LEDs and switch
11.1) Turn on every other LED
11.2) Have operator press button
11.3) Invert every LED
11.4) Have operator press button again

12) Test HDMI
12.1) Ask: Does the image show up on the screen?
